        I had heartburn from a chocolate chip cookie made by a specific company, but when I had a chocolate chip cookie made by a different company, I did not get heartburn.<br /><br />

      </blockquote>
      <p>It is our opinion that heartburn may be caused by a specific ingredient or group of ingredients rather than a type of food a person eats.</p>
      <h3><strong>Reducing heartburn starts with what you eat and what drink!</strong></h3>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>How do people have heartburn?</h3>
      <p>Heartburn occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes and allows stomach fluids (stomach acid and food) back up into the esophagus.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>What triggers heartburn?</h3>
      <p>Many doctors believe there are several foods that are listed to be risk factors in causing heartburn.</p>
      <p>Some of these include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li className="list">Spicy foods</li>
        <li className="list">Citrus foods</li>
        <li className="list">Onions</li>
        <li className="list">Tomatoes and tomato products</li>
        <li className="list">Fried foods</li>
        <li className="list">Alcohol</li>
        <li className="list">Coffee and some teas</li>
        <li className="list">Peppermint</li>
      </ul>
